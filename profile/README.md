WeaveVM (WVM) is the first EVM-compatible network engineered to manage complex, large-scale data computation without the high gas fees typically associated with on-chain state storage on EVM chains. WVM is also the first EVM-compatible network that fully relies on Arweave for decentralized data storage, enabling atomicity of source code and data storage on the same ledger. 

> WVM end-goal is a hyperscalable EVM network with near-instant finality and full onchain storage.

## Nomenclature
The WeaveVM (WVM)  name signifies the integration of Arweave with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. WVM unites Arweave's data storage capabilities ("weave") with the functionalities of the EVM ("-eVM").

## Can WeaveVM be labeled as an L2?
Before determining whether WeaveVM fits the criteria for being classified as an L2 (Layer 2) solution, let's check the accurate definition for a layer 2 (L2):

> "A layer 2 refers to any off-chain network, system, or technology built on top of a blockchain (commonly known as a layer-1 network) that helps extend the capabilities of the underlying base layer network. Layer-2 networks can support any blockchain to introduce enhancements such as higher transaction throughputs." - [Chainlink docs](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-layer-2)

Presently, numerous networks leveraging Ethereum or EVM are labeled as L2 despite not meeting this fundamental prerequisite:
> "One core requirement for a network, system, or technology to be considered a layer 2 is that it inherits the security of the blockchain it is built on top of. Transaction data must, in some shape or form, be verified and confirmed by the underlying blockchain network rather than a separate set of nodes."

Therefore, WeaveVM might not strictly fit the definition of a traditional Layer 2 solution within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, It operates as an EVM-compatible sovereign network utilizing Arweave for data storage and inheriting its security, which can position it as "L1.5" or simply, L1.
